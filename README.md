# 🏷️ Java Annotations & Metadata

## 📄 Description
This repository contains a set of practical Java exercises designed to master **Java Annotations** and **Object-Oriented Hierarchies**. The goal is to improve code clarity and maintainability using standard annotations like `@Override` and `@Deprecated`, as well as understanding how to create **Custom Annotations** to define metadata for specific tasks, such as **JSON Serialization**.

## 📚 Exercise Details

### Level 1: Standard Annotations & Polymorphism
**Exercise 1: Override & Inheritance**
The objective is to build a class hierarchy to manage different types of workers and calculate their salaries using polymorphism.

* **Classes:**
    * `Worker` (Base class): Attributes include `name`, `surname`, and `pricePerHour`.
    * `OnlineWorker`: Inherits from `Worker`.
    * `FaceToFaceWorker`: Inherits from `Worker`.
* **Logic:**
    * The base class has a method `calculateSalary(int hours)`.
    * Child classes must override this method using the **`@Override`** annotation.
    * **FaceToFaceWorker Calculation:** Multiplies hours by price/hour and adds a **static** attribute called `gasoline`.
    * **OnlineWorker Calculation:** Multiplies hours by price/hour and adds a **constant** attribute representing the internet flat rate.
* **Execution:**
    * The `Main` class demonstrates the correct usage of `@Override` and polymorphism by invoking the methods on different worker instances.

**Exercise 2: Deprecated Methods**
The goal is to understand how to mark code as obsolete and handle legacy code warnings.

* **Implementation:**
    * Add obsolete methods to the child classes and mark them with **`@Deprecated`**.
    * Invoke these methods from an external class.
    * Use **`@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`** to suppress the compiler warnings generated by using the obsolete methods.

### Level 2: Custom Annotations
**Exercise 1: JSON Serialization Annotation**
The goal is to step beyond standard annotations and create a custom one to define metadata for file processing.

* **Objective:** Create a custom annotation to indicate that a Java object should be serialized into a JSON file.
* **Parameters:**
    * The annotation must accept a parameter specifying the **destination directory** where the resulting JSON file will be placed.
* **Concept:** This exercise introduces how annotations can influence program logic when interpreted by additional tools or reflection.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* **Java 21** - Core language for logic, inheritance, and annotations.
* **IDE** (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse) - Development environment.
* **Git** - Version control.

## 📋 Requirements
* **Java SDK 17** or higher installed locally.
* Basic understanding of:
    * Java OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism).
    * Java Annotation syntax (`@Interface`).
    * `static` and `final` modifiers.

## 🛠️ Installation
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/federicopratico/1.7-Annotations-Level2.git
    ```
    or with SSH:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:federicopratico/1.7-Annotations-Level2.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 1.7-Annotations-Level2
    ```
3.  Open the project in your preferred IDE.

## 🚀 Execute
Each level is separated into its own package. To run the exercises:

1.  **Compile the project** using your IDE or terminal.
2.  **Run Level 1:**
    Find the `Main` class in the `Level1` package and run it to see the Salary calculation and Deprecation warnings.
3.  **Run Level 2:**
    Find the `Main` class in the `Level2` package to test the Custom Annotation definition.
